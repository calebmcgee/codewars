Data. (currentPosition = 2,4) (boatStart = 2,3) (cells = 1) (totalBoats [4cell = 0, 3cell = 1, 2cell = 0, 1cell = 0]) (currentBoat = 4,3)

1. Seeing if we are at a boat
1a. Check if boat @ currentPosition
    boat @ currentPosition : ask are we in middle of boat?
        middle of boat: cells += 1, go to 2 
        not middle of boat : (boatStart = currentPosition), cells +=1, go to 2
    no boat @ currentPosition: (currentPosition = x increase by 1), return to 1a

2. Finding size of boat (currentBoat = boatStart) (cells = 1 => 3)
2a. Check if boat below currentBoat
    boat below: cells += 1, (currentBoat = increase y by 1), repeat 2a
        no boat below: 
            cells > 1 : register boat by cells, (currentPosition =increase x by 1), return to 1a 
            cells = 1: go to 2b *means boat is horizontal or single cell*
2b. Check if boat to right of currentBoat
        boat right: cells += 1, (currentBoat = increase x by 1), (currentPosition = increase x by 1), repeat 2b
        no boat right: register boat by cells, (currentPosition = increase x by 1), return to 1a 


Reach end of array

3 check totalBoats
    correct amount of boats: field is valid
    incorrect amount of boats: field is invalid

idk how to check for diagonals
