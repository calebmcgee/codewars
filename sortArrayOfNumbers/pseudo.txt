Sort array of numbers from least to greatest





array = [15, 10, 25, 3, 18]
new array = [15, 10, 25, 3, 18]
i = 0
j = 0
a = 
b = 

1. a = index i of array 
if value of i > value of i + 1
    go to 2
otherwise 
    i + 1

2.  b = index j of array

    if a >= b 
        increase j by 1, repeat step 2
    if a < b
        first index of = value of j-1
        set index j - 1 to a
        j = 0, repeat from 1
